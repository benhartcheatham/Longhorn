These should all probably be github issues but here we are...

1. Memory allocation
    - test kmalloc
    - use the GRUB mem map to mark off non-usuable areas of memory
2. Processes
    - Way to kill processes
    - Way to gracefully exit when a process has no live threads
    - Idle Process
3. Threads
    - Test threads
5. Housekeeping
    - format all .c files according to Planning.txt
    - format all .h files according to Planning.txt
6. Keyboard Driver
    - Decide if driver should write keycodes into the stdin of the process, or ascii as it is now.
7. List
    - Make a list iterator set of functions
        - should only give const pointers so modification isn't possible
8. Linking
    - Don't let kernel images over 1MB be made
9. libk
    - semaphores (maybe should be in kernel subdir)
    - should maybe move these files into a subdir of kernel (called like data_types or something)
10. libc
    - get rid of the mem.h file and put those functions in string.has
    - move all functions out of string.h/stdio.h(?) and into their own files
