*****THIS IS THE MASTER BRANCH*****

CURRENT: Test new string functions

1. Memory allocation
    - test kmalloc
    - use the GRUB mem map to mark off non-usuable areas of memory
2. Processes
    - Way to create processes from terminal
    - Way to kill processes from terminal
    - Idle Process
3. Threads
    - Test threads
    - Test thread cleanup
    - Blocking/Unblocking threads
5. Housekeeping
    - format all .c files according to README
    - format all .h files according to README
    - figure out a naming convention for typedefs
6. Linking
    - Don't let kernel images over 1MB be made
        - Probably need to wait until i have an assert command like in PintOS
7. libk
    - semaphores (should probably be in kernel subdir)
    - should maybe move these files into a subdir of kernel (called like data_types or something)
8. libc
    - get rid of the mem.h file and put those functions in string.h
    - move all functions out of string.h/stdio.h(?) and into their own files 
    - Implement string.h functions based on C99 (half done)
    - Put the string functions in order in string.h
