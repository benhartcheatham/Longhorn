These should all probably be github issues but here we are...

0. Graphics
    - Get rid of graphics interface and make a vga terminal and a vesa terminal
    - speed up graphics driver somehow
1. Memory allocation
    - test kmalloc
    - use the GRUB mem map to mark off non-usuable areas of memory
2. Processes
    - Way to create processes from terminal
    - Way to kill processes from terminal
    - Way to gracefully exit when a process has no live threads
        - Tied to thread cleanup
    - Idle Process
3. Threads
    - Test threads
    - Cleanup dead/dying threads
5. Housekeeping
    - format all .c files according to Planning.txt
    - format all .h files according to Planning.txt
6. Keyboard Driver
    - Decide if driver should write keycodes into the stdin of the process, or ascii as it is now.
7. Linking
    - Don't let kernel images over 1MB be made
8. libk
    - semaphores (should probably be in kernel subdir)
    - should maybe move these files into a subdir of kernel (called like data_types or something)
9. libc
    - get rid of the mem.h file and put those functions in string.h
    - move all functions out of string.h/stdio.h(?) and into their own files 
    - Implement string.h functions based on C99
