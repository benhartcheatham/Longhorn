Process and Thread Rework Plan:

*** Each thread will eventually have a kernel stack and user stack, this is for the kernel stack ***
- Threads will share the address space of their parent process, each with their own stack
- Threads will share the same std streams as the parent process
- Will want to (eventually) store more of the thread state for when they are switched
- Process exit/kill should try to kill any remaining threads (threads that have a lock/semaphore will need to be able to run
  until the release them, don't know how to do that, maybe they just release them in kill?)
- Should allow set_active to take a process pointer that way threads can set their parent to the active process
