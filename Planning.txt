This file is for planning out new features.

Processes:
    - Should have a stdin, stdout, and stderror stream
        - Might be better suited as files on the system
    - Array of threads owned by Process
    - Active thread in Process
    - Way to kill Processes
        - Way to kill threads within Process
            - If thread isn't in process, kills the entire process
            - Can't kill init Process?
    - Parental Hierarchy between Processes?
    - Idle Process
    - List of Processes

    When File I/O is Added:
    - Pointer to the stack segment
        - Each thread should have it's own stack in this segment
        - Each thread saves state when swapping
    - Pointer to the text segment
    - Pointer to the data segment
